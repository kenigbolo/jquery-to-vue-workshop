# jquery-to-vue-workshop

A workshop for migrating a legacy JQuery app to Vue JS

## Set up

To get started, begin by installing the required node js dependencies. To do
this run

```javascript
npm install
```

once all modules are successfully installed, start the app in development mode
by running

```javascript
npm run watch
```

This should set up nodemon for reloading javascript changes. The web app can be
accessible on `localhost:9999` after the app has been started in dev mode
